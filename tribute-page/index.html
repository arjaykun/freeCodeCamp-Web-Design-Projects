		<h3>About Him</h3>
		<p>
			Baam entered the Tower in search of his best friend Rachel, another Irregular,[14][15] who wanted to climb to the top of the Tower and see the stars.  Prior to passing Headon's test he was deemed worthy of climbing the Tower. Before ascending, however, Baam is required to pass the Testing Floors (starting at Floor 2) which are there to weed out anyone that could be harmful to the Tower, and in the process he puts together a strong team.  After later being forcibly recruited into FUG, Baam joined Team Tangsooyook and managed to escape from FUG's clutches, eventually reuniting with his old friends and teammates. Due to his affiliations with FUG, he also goes by the name Jue Viole Grace (쥬 비올레 그레이스, Jyu Biolle Geuleiseu). After the battle of the last station, he decided to return to FUG in order to become more powerful to track down Kallavan and prepare for the war against his army.
